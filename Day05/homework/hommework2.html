        <p>Le Male is a men's fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian for Jean Paul Gaultier in 1995. "Le Male" is very close in scent profile (Some would say it's a clone/homage) to Cuba Gold (Paris) which was introduced in 1979, It has been manufactured by Puig since 2016, and was previously manufactured by Shiseido subsidiary Beaut√© Prestige International from 1995 until 2015. The fragrance was developed as a counterpart to the women's fragrance Classique, which was introduced in 1993.</p>
