    <h1>football</h1>
<p>Football is a team sport in which two teams of eleven players play against each other. The game is played on a rectangular field with goals at either end. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball between team members to score a goal in the opposing team's goal. According to the main characteristic rule of this sport, players, except the goalkeeper, are not allowed to use their hands or arms on the ball during the game. The winner of the match is the team that scores more goals until the end of the game.</p>

<p>Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or what the British and many other people around the world call “football,” into the game we know today.</p>
